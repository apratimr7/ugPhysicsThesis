  abstract = {A systematic method is developed which allows one to identify certain important classes of evolution equations which can be solved by the method of inverse scattering. The form of each evolution equation is characterized by the dispersion relation of its associated linearized version and an integro-differential operator. A comprehensive presentation of the inverse scattering method is given and general features of the solution are discussed. The relationship of the scattering theory and Backlund transformations is brought out. In view of the role of the dispersion relation, the comparatively simple asymptotic states, and the similarity of the method itself to Fourier transforms, this theory can be considered a natural extension of Fourier analysis to nonlinear problems.},

  abstract = {We review the properties of optical spatial dissipative solitons (SDS). These are stable, self-localized optical excitations sitting on a uniform, or quasi-uniform, background in a dissipative environment like a nonlinear optical cavity. Indeed in optics they are often termed ‘cavity solitons’. We discuss their dynamics and interactions in both ideal and imperfect systems, making comparison with experiments. SDS in lasers offer important advantages for applications. We review candidate schemes and the tremendous recent progress in semiconductor-based cavity soliton lasers. We examine SDS in periodic structures, and we show how SDS can be quantitatively related to the locking of fronts. We conclude with an assessment of potential applications of SDS in photonics, arguing that best use of their particular features is made by exploiting their mobility, e.g. in all-optical delay lines.},

Goodman Book Writing Award for his work on Nonlinear Fiber Optics, 3rd edition. Nonlinear Fiber Optics, 3rd Edition, provides a comprehensive and uptodate account of the nonlinear phenomena occurring inside optical fibers. It retains most of the material that appeared in the first edition, with the exception of Chapter 6, which is now devoted to the polarization effects relevant for light propagation in optical fibers. The contents include such important topics as self and crossphase modulation, stimulated Raman and Brillouin scattering, fourwave mixing, modulation instability, and optical solutons. A proper understanding of these topics is essential for scientists and engineers interested in various aspects of lightwave technology. Such an ambitious objective increased the size of the book to the extent that it was necessary to create a separate but complimentary book, Applications of Nonlinear Fiber Optics, which is devoted to applications in the domain of lightwave technology. This revised edition of Nonlinear Fiber Optics should serve well the needs of the scientific community including graduate students in Optics, Physics, and Electrical Engineering, engineers in the optical communication industry, and scientists working in fiber optics and nonlinear optics. * Only book dealing with Nonlinear Fiber Optics * Comprehensive uptodate coverage of the entire field * Problems at the end of each chapter suitable for a course * Focus on fundamental aspects * Can be used by graduate students doing research in or taking courses in nonlinear optics and optical communications},

We show numerically the presence of cavity solitons in the system: they exist as solitary structures formed through a modulationally unstable homogeneous lasing state that coexists with a background with zero intensity. Such a peculiar scenario endows the solitons with unique properties compared to cavity solitons in most previously studied optical systems. In particular, these solitons do not as such rely on a proper phase of the addressing pulses to be either created or deleted. We show that exciting and deleting the solitons depend crucially on whether a threshold in the soliton peak has been reached.},

Since reflectivities are difficult to measure experimentally, it is necessary to know whether these high relectivities can be attained in theory.

Introduction of frequency-dependent losses is shown to allow stabilization of dissipative solitons in a complex Ginzburg-Landau model with simple cubic or saturable nonlinearity. Analytic solutions are found for the former case in one dimension (ID), and robust solitons are found numerically in two dimensions (2D), and for the saturable case. Separation into spectral and spatial-nonlinear problems is an effective and flexible technique to guide analysis, numerics and experiment.},

They are generated by shining a writing/erasing laser pulse into a nonlinear optical cavity, driven by a holding beam. The ability to control their location and their motion by introducing phase or amplitude gradients in the holding beam makes them interesting as mobile pixels for all-optical processing units. We show the generation of a number of cavity solitons in broad area vertical cavity semiconductor microresonators electrically pumped above transparency but slightly below threshold. The observed spots can be written, erased and manipulated as independent objects. We analyze experimentally the cavity solitons domain of existence in the parameter space and how their characteristics are affected by inhomogeneities and impurities of the vertical cavity devices. A theoretical model, keeping into account the devices characteristics, reproduces numerically the experimental observations with good agreement.},

This equation governs the evolution of slowly varying envelopes of periodic spatio-temporal patterns related to Rayleigh–Bénard convective instabilities. In addition, the phase instabilities of the complex GLE (CGLE) with quintic and space-dependent cubic terms modelling the Eckhaus and zigzag convective instabilities are reported. We find soliton solution classes to the elliptic and hyperbolic CGLE, by applying the function transformation method. The two-dimensional CGLE is transformed to a sine-Gordon equation, a sinh-Gordon equation and other equations, which depend only on one function χ. The general solution of the equation in χ leads to a general soliton solution of the two-dimensional CGLE. The obtained solutions contain some interesting specific solutions such as plane solitons, N multiple solitons and propagating breathers. We also discuss the soliton stability of the CGLE.},

This extension has been done by replacing the conventional semiconductor saturable absorber with a graphene saturable absorber in the microcavity based on a vertical-cavity surface emitting laser coupled with a frequency-selective feedback. The replacement gives rise to cavity solitons in ultraviolet and visible zone, significantly lowers down the required feedback strength as well as the threshold pump power for cavity soliton generation. The spontaneous drift as well as “push broom” dynamics of cavity solitons are observed for all wavelength zones. Since the graphene saturable absorber layer can show broadband operation, it eliminates the necessity of using different saturable absorber layer and their corresponding substrates for different spectral zones. By virtue of graphene's high nonlinearity, single layer structure and easy integration with silicon photonic microresonators our model is a step forward towards the on-chip cavity soliton generator.},

For low pump currents, we find that they emerge from the modulational instability point of the trivial solution, where traveling waves with a critical wave number are formed. For large currents, the branch of self-propelled solitons merges with the branch of resting solitons via a pitchfork bifurcation. We also show that a feedback phase variation of ±2⁢𝜋 can transform a CS (whether resting or moving) into a different one associated to an adjacent longitudinal external cavity mode. Finally, we investigate the influence of the carrier dynamics, relevant for VCSELs. We find and analyze qualitative changes in the stability properties of resting CSs when increasing the carrier relaxation time. In addition to a drifting instability of resting CSs, a distinctive kind of instability appears for certain ranges of carrier lifetime, leading to a swinging motion of the CS center position. Furthermore, for carrier relaxation times typical of VCSELs the system can display multistability of CSs.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Modulation Instability is studied in the presence of an external periodic potential in microresonator comprising of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser with saturable absorber and frequency selective feedback. The role of intensity of input field, pump parameter, diffraction coefficient and saturable absorption on the modulation instability has been investigated. Thus, Modulation instability can be tuned by varying the system parameters. This aspect would be beneficial for the purpose of encryption. It is also observed that modulation instability is not explicitly dependent on externally applied potential whereas the effect of potential is shown implicitly by using numerical analysis. The presence of an external potential give the operating range of resonance frequency of the optical cavity instead of one value at the same system parameters. This operating range of resonance frequency is spatially dependent and varies with the system parameters.},

We derive the explicit formulae for the spatial derivative and an explicit scheme by splitting the equation into a system of two parabolic PDEs. We prove the conditional convergence of the numerical scheme towards the continuous solution under certain assumptions. We obtain a second order approximation as it is clear from the numerical results. Finally, we provide several examples of its application over irregular domains in order to test the accuracy of the explicit scheme, as well as comparison with other numerical methods.},

  abstract = {Solitons are stable localized wave packets that can propagate long distance in dispersive media without changing their shapes. As particle-like nonlinear localized waves, solitons have been investigated in different physical systems. Owing to potential applications in optical communication and optical signal processing systems, optical solitons have attracted intense interest in the past three decades. To experimentally study the formation and dynamics of temporal optical solitons, fiber lasers are considered as a wonderful nonlinear system. During the last decade, several kinds of theoretically predicted solitons were observed experimentally in fiber lasers. In this review, we present a detailed overview of the experimentally verified optical solitons in fiber lasers, including bright solitons, dark solitons, vector solitons, dissipative solitons, dispersion-managed solitons, polarization domain wall solitons, and so on. An outlook for the development on the solitons in fiber lasers is also provided and discussed.},

  abstract = {Based on the nonlocal nonlinear Schrödinger equation, the pattern transformation and control of transverse cross-modulated sine-Gaussian breathing solitons during transmission are studied. Several expressions have been derived, including the transmission, soliton width, soliton width change rate, soliton width extrema and their change rates, and phase wavefront curvature and its extrema. The research results demonstrate that the sine term coefficient in the initial electric field expression controls the pattern transformation of the breathing solitons. The breathing solitons can form generalized spatial solitons and breathers during transmission. The evolution of the soliton width extrema and their change rates with the sine term coefficient is investigated. The influence of the initial incident power and the sine term coefficient on the soliton width change rate and phase wavefront curvature extrema is studied.},

  abstract = {We report results of systematic numerical analysis of collisions between two and three stable dissipative solitons in the two-dimensional (2D) complex Ginzburg- Landau equation (CGLE) with the cubic-quintic (CQ) combination of gain and loss terms. The equation may be realized as a model of a laser cavity which includes the spatial diffraction, together with the anomalous group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and spectral filtering acting in the temporal direction. Collisions between solitons are possible due to the Galilean invariance along the spatial axis. Outcomes of the collisions are identified by varying the GVD coefficient, D, and the collision "velocity" (actually, it is the spatial slope of the soliton's trajectory). At small velocities, two or three in-phase solitons merge into a single standing one. At larger velocities, both in-phase soliton pairs and pairs of solitons with opposite signs suffer a transition into a delocalized chaotic state. At still larger velocities, all collisions become quasi-elastic. A new outcome is revealed by collisions between slow solitons with opposite signs: they self-trap into persistent wobbling dipoles, which are found in two modifications (horizontal at smaller D, and vertical if D is larger (the horizontal ones resemble "zigzag" bound states of two solitons known in the 1D CGL equation of the CQ type). Collisions between solitons with a finite mismatch between their trajectories are studied too.},
