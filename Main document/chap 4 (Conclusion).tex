In the work, we have studied the formation and entrapment of cavity soliton (CS) 
in vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSELs) coupled with saturable absorber (SA)
and frequency selective feedback mechanism (FSF) under central peak shaped potential functions. 
The governing equation for the system mentioned, complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), is 
used to numerically simulate the dynamics using split-step Fourier method (SSFM) for four different 
potentials. It was found that the central peak in the potentials can successfully trap the CS. 
This is important because of various potential applications in optical communication and optical 
computing. 

Further the stability analysis using Lyapunov Exponent with respect to the significant 
system parameters: pump parameter for active medium $\mu$ and feedback strength parameter 
$\sigma$, showed us the region where the system can be stable. 

The future direction should be to find out more potential that can effectively trap the 
cavity soliton and figure out how effectively we can manipulate the dynamics of CS.
